To play the game, all you need is the Clappy Bird Windows Build folder. Download the folder, run Clappy Bird.exe file and clap away.

**Description**
Did you always feel like Flappy Bird is missing that certain something? Was it always too dull, too 
easy to play and too… wholesome? Then check out Clappy Bird! It’s pretty much like Flappy Bird, but 
all grown up, including some rough teenage years.

You are playing the role of a bird. But you don’t have wings. What do you fly with? Take some arms 
instead! Why are you flying? To escape the Seven Circles of Hell, of course! Clap your hands to fly, 
and escape those evil hands trying to drag you back all the way down.

**How to play**
It’s very simple: Just clap your hands! With every clap, the bird will fly up. Your goal is to avoid the 
small arms on the ground and the big hands you encounter on your way. Hitting them once will only 
give you a black eye, but the second hit will kill you (don’t worry, it’s quick and painless). The more 
hands you avoid, the higher your score will grow.

Here are some tips to help you to a better playing experience:
1. Locate yourself in a quiet environment – You are supposed to clap, but all sounds that are 
loud enough can cause the bird to fly.
2. Clap a table instead of your hands – while clapping with your hands gives you the truest 
experience, using a table can greatly increase the endurance of your hands.
3. Try to keep the loudness of the claps as even as possible – if a clap is too loud, the bird might 
overreact and jump twice
